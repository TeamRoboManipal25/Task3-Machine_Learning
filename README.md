# 📄 Task Description  

For this task, you will practice implementing **Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using NumPy** and visualizing results using **Matplotlib**.  
There is **no separate report** for this task.  

You are required to complete two sub-tasks — **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**.

---

## 🧠 Task 1: Linear Regression  

### 🎯 Objective  
Predict **Student Exam Performance** using Linear Regression.  

You are given a dataset `student_exam_scores.csv` containing information about students’ study habits, attendance, and previous academic performance.  
Your goal is to build a model that predicts the final exam score based on these factors.  

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Logistic Regression  

### 🎯 Objective  
Develop a predictive model to determine whether a patient is likely to have **heart disease** based on medical parameters.  

You are given the dataset `Medicaldataset.csv` containing various physiological and biochemical measurements.
